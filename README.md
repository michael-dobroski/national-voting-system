# National Voting System

This is an in-depth software engineering project from my academic days at the University of Iowa. It was an Agile simulation project that took place over the course of one semester (five months). We used a Hybrid Agile-Scrum approach to capitalize on the ever-changing client requirements and team size of four people. 

## How to Run

Open the project in your favorite IDE.

> pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt

## FOR MYSQL use
The initial DB is located in the MySQL folder and named DatabaseV1Team1.sql, to use this you will need to download it and then import it to your local MySQL Workbench environment. Make any changes to it and then when you go to export it make sure that it is 1 file for everything and to add it to this repo in the MySQL folder.

Note: the first edition of the DB with changes will be named DDLChange01ToDBV1Team1.sql, DDLChange02ToDBV1Team1.sql and so on. This will help us keep track of the current versions we are using...
