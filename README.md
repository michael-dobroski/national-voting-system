# SW_Project

This is the main project for CS:5800 that we will use.

Testing changes and push ability.

For sonar use, any changes made will directly go to Sonar Service.

To check the results of Sonar, go to https://sonarqube.cs.uiowa.edu/

Note: Need to be on vpn.uiowa.edu to accomplish the above.

## FOR MYSQL use
The initial DB is located in the MySQL folder and named DatabaseV1Team1.sql, to use this you will need to download it and then import it to your local MySQL Workbench environment. Make any changes to it and then when you go to export it make sure that it is 1 file for everything and to add it to this repo in the MySQL folder.

Note: the first edition of the DB with changes will be named DDLChange01ToDBV1Team1.sql, DDLChange02ToDBV1Team1.sql and so on. This will help us keep track of the current versions we are using...
